Draw subhalo masses and concentrations for NFW subhalos in a WDM universe
following a combination of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02573.pdf,
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01125.pdf, and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01998.pdf.

This module contains the functions needed to turn the parameters of warm dark
matter subhalo distributions into masses, concentrations, and positions for
those subhalos.
